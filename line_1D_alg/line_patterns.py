'''
  line_patterns is a stand-alone version of 1st-level 1D algorithm
  Operations:
  -
- Cross-compare consecutive pixels within each row of image, forming dert_: queue of derts, each a tuple of derivatives per pixel.
  dert_ is then segmented into patterns Pms and Pds: contiguous sequences of pixels forming same-sign match or difference.
  Initial match is inverse deviation of variation: m = ave_|d| - |d|,
  rather than a minimum for directly defined match: albedo of an object doesn't correlate with its predictive value.
  -
- Match patterns Pms are spans of inputs forming same-sign match. Positive Pms contain high-match pixels, which are likely
  to match more distant pixels. Thus, positive Pms are evaluated for cross-comp of pixels over incremented range.
  -
- Difference patterns Pds are spans of inputs forming same-sign ds. d sign match is a precondition for d match, so only
  same-sign spans (Pds) are evaluated for cross-comp of constituent differences, which forms higher derivatives.
  (d match = min: rng+ comp value: predictive value of difference is proportional to its magnitude, although inversely so)
  -
  Both extended cross-comp forks are recursive: resulting sub-patterns are evaluated for deeper cross-comp, same as top patterns.
  These forks here are exclusive per P to avoid redundancy, but they do overlap in line_patterns_olp.
