'''
line_PPs is a 2nd-level 1D algorithm, its input is Ps formed by the 1st-level line_patterns.
It cross-compares Ps (s, L, I, D, M, dert_, layers) and evaluates them for deeper cross-comparison.
Range or derivation of cross-comp is selectively increased if the match from prior-order cross-comp is above threshold,
search up to max rel distance +|- contrast borrow, with bi-directional selection?
-
comp s: if same-sign, cross-sign comp is borrow, also default L and M (core param) comp?
comp (L, I, D, M): equal-weight, select redundant I | (D,M),  div L if V_var * D_vars, and same-sign d_vars?
comp (dert_):  lower composition than layers, if any
comp (layers):  same-derivation elements
comp (P_):  sub patterns
-
Increment of 2nd level alg over 1st level alg should be made recursive, forming relative-level meta-algorithm.
Comparison distance is extended to first match or maximal accumulated miss over compared derPs, measured by roL*roM?
Match or miss may be between Ps of either sign, but comparison of lower P layers is conditional on higher-layer match
-
Comparison between two Ps is of variable-depth P hierarchy, with sign at the top, until max higher-layer miss.
This is vertical induction: results of higher-layer comparison predict results of next-layer comparison,
similar to lateral induction: variable-range comparison among Ps, until first match or max prior-Ps miss.
-
Resulting PPs will be more like 1D graphs, with explicit distances between nearest element Ps.
This is different from 1st level connectivity clustering, where all distances between nearest elements = 1.
Negative PPms and PPds are not formed: contrast value can't be assumed because all Ps are terminated.
form PPd if min(PP.(M+mP), dP) > ave_dP, then sub-recursion as div_comp ) der_comp?
also deeper backward search for strong Pm s?
Sub-recursion if no template replacement by nearest-match: no strict continuity
different from range_comp in that elements can be distant, but also always positive?
