'''
comp_pixel (lateral, vertical, diagonal) forms dert, queued in dert__: tuples of pixel + derivatives, over the whole frame.
Coefs scale down pixel dy and dx contribution to kernel g in proportion to the ratio of that pixel distance and angle 
to ortho-pixel distance and angle. This is a proximity-ordered search, comparing ortho-pixels first, thus their coef = 1.  

This is a more precise equivalent to Sobel operator, but works in reverse, the latter sets diagonal pixel coef = 1, and scales 
contribution of other pixels up, in proportion to the same ratios (relative contribution of each rim pixel to g in Sobel is 
similar but lower resolution). This forms integer coefs, vs our fractional coefs, which makes computation a lot faster. 
We will probably switch to integer coefs for speed, and are open to using Scharr operator in the future.

kwidth = 3: input-centered, low resolution kernel: frame | blob shrink by 2 pixels per row,
kwidth = 2: co-centered, grid shift, 1-pixel row shrink, no deriv overlap, 1/4 chance of boundary pixel in kernel?
kwidth = 2: quadrant g = ((dx + dy) * .705 + d_diag) / 2, no i res decrement, ders co-location, + orthogonal quadrant for full rep?
