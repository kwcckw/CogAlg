'''
    comp_slice_ is a terminal fork of intra_blob.
    It traces blob axis by cross-comparing vertically adjacent Ps: horizontal slices across an edge blob.
    These high-G high-Ma blobs are vectorized into outlines of adjacent flat or low-G blobs.
    Vectorization is clustering of Ps + derivatives into PPs: patterns of Ps that describe an edge.
    Double edge lines: assumed match between edges of high-deviation intensity, no need for cross-comp?
    secondary cross-comp of low-deviation blobs?   P comb -> intra | inter comp eval?
    radial comp extension for co-internal blobs:
    != sign comp x sum( adj_blob_) -> intra_comp value, isolation value, cross-sign merge if weak, else:
    == sign comp x ind( adj_adj_blob_) -> same-sign merge | composition:
    borrow = adj_G * rA: default sum div_comp S -> relative area and distance to adjj_blob_
    internal sum comp if mA: in thin lines only? comp_norm_G or div_comp_G -> rG?
    isolation = decay + contrast:
    G - G * (rA * ave_rG: decay) - (rA * adj_G: contrast, = lend | borrow, no need to compare vG?)
    if isolation: cross adjj_blob composition eval,
    else:         cross adjj_blob merge eval:
    blob merger if internal match (~raG) - isolation, rdn external match:
    blob compos if external match (~rA?) + isolation,
    Also eval comp_slice over fork_?
    rng+ should preserve resolution: rng+_dert_ is dert layers,
    rng_sum-> rng+, der+: whole rng, rng_incr-> angle / past vs next g,
    rdn Rng | rng_ eval at rng term, Rng -= lost coord bits mag, always > discr?
