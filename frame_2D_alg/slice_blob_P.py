    This is a terminal fork of intra_blob.
    slice_blob converts selected smooth-edge blobs (high G, low Ga) into sliced blobs, adding internal P and stack structures.
    It then calls comp_g and comp_P per stack, to trace and vectorize these edges.
    No vectorization for flat blobs?

    Pixel-level parameters are accumulated in contiguous spans of same-sign gradient, first horizontally then vertically.
    Horizontal blob slices are Ps: 1D patterns, and vertical spans are first stacks of Ps, then blob of connected stacks.

    This processing adds a level of encoding per row y, defined relative to y of current input row, with top-down scan:
    1Le, line y-1: form_P( dert_) -> 1D pattern P: contiguous row segment, a slice of a blob
    2Le, line y-2: scan_P_(P, hP) -> hP, up_connect_, down_connect_count: vertical connections per stack of Ps
    3Le, line y-3: form_stack(hP, stack) -> stack: merge vertically-connected _Ps into non-forking stacks of Ps
    4Le, line y-4+ stack depth: term_stack(stack, blob): merge terminated stack into up_connect_, recursively
    Higher-row elements include additional parameters, derived while they were lower-row elements.

    Resulting blob structure (fixed set of parameters per blob):
    - Dert: summed pixel-level dert params, Dx, surface area S, vertical depth Ly
    - sign = s: sign of gradient deviation
    - box  = [y0, yn, x0, xn],
    - dert__,  # 2D array of pixel-level derts: (p, dy, dx, g, m) tuples
    - stack_,  # contains intermediate blob composition structures: stacks and Ps, not meaningful on their own
    ( intra_blob structure extends Dert, adds fork params and sub_layers)

Parameterized connectivity clustering functions below:
- form_P sums dert params within P and increments its L: horizontal length.
- scan_P_ searches for horizontal (x) overlap between Ps of consecutive (in y) rows.
- form_stack combines these overlapping Ps into vertical stacks of Ps, with one up_P to one down_P
- term_stack merges terminated stacks into blob

dert: tuple of derivatives per pixel, initially (p, dy, dx, g), extended in intra_blob
Dert: params of cluster structures (P, stack, blob): summed dert params + dimensions: vertical Ly and area A
