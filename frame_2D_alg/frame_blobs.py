'''
    2D version of first-level core algorithm will have frame_blobs, intra_blob (recursive search within blobs), and comp_P.
    frame_blobs() forms parameterized blobs: contiguous areas of positive or negative deviation of gradient per pixel.    
    comp_pixel (lateral, vertical, diagonal) forms dert, queued in dert__: tuples of pixel + derivatives, over whole image. 

    Then pixel-level and external parameters are accumulated in row segment Ps, vertical blob segment, and blobs,
    adding a level of encoding per row y, defined relative to y of current input row, with top-down scan:

    1Le, line y-1: form_P( dert_) -> 1D pattern P: contiguous row segment, a slice of a blob
    2Le, line y-2: scan_P_(P, hP) -> hP, up_connect_, down_connect_count: vertical connections per stack of Ps 
    3Le, line y-3: form_stack(hP, stack) -> stack: merge vertically-connected _Ps into non-forking stacks of Ps
    4Le, line y-4+ stack depth: form_blob(stack, blob): merge connected stacks in blobs referred by up_connect_, recursively

    Higher-row elements include additional parameters, derived while they were lower-row elements. Processing is bottom-up:
    from input-row to higher-row structures, sequential because blobs are irregular, not suited for matrix operations.

    Resulting blob structure (fixed set of parameters per blob): 
    - Dert = I, G, Dy, Dx, S, Ly: summed pixel-level dert params I, G, Dy, Dx, surface area S, vertical depth Ly
    - sign = s: sign of gradient deviation
    - box  = [y0, yn, x0, xn], 
    - dert__,  # 2D array of pixel-level derts: (p, g, dy, dx) tuples
    - stack_,  # contains intermediate blob composition structures: stacks and Ps, not meaningful on their own
    ( intra_blob structure extends Dert, adds fork params and sub_layers)

    Blob is 2D pattern: connectivity cluster defined by the sign of gradient deviation. Gradient represents 2D variation
    per pixel. It is used as inverse measure of partial match (predictive value) because direct match (min intensity) 
    is not meaningful in vision. Intensity of reflected light doesn't correlate with predictive value of observed object 
    (predictive value is physical density, hardness, inertia that represent resistance to change in positional parameters)  

    This is clustering by connectivity because distance between clustered pixels should not exceed cross-comparison range.
    That range is fixed for each layer of search, to enable encoding of input pose parameters: coordinates, dimensions, 
    orientation. These params are essential because value of prediction = precision of what * precision of where. 

    frame_blobs is a complex function with a simple purpose: to sum pixel-level params in blob-level params. These params 
    were derived by pixel cross-comparison (cross-correlation) to represent predictive value per pixel, so they are also
    predictive on a blob level, and should be cross-compared between blobs on the next level of search and composition.

Parameterized connectivity clustering functions below:
- form_P sums dert params within P and increments its L: horizontal length.
- scan_P_ searches for horizontal (x) overlap between Ps of consecutive (in y) rows.
- form_stack combines these overlapping Ps into vertical stacks of Ps, with 1 up_P to 1 down_P
- form_blob merges terminated or forking stacks into blob, removes redundant representations of the same blob

    Each P in P_ scans higher-row _Ps (in stack_) left-to-right, testing for x-overlaps between Ps and same-sign _Ps.
    Overlap is represented as up_connect in P and is added to down_connect_cnt in _P. Scan continues until P.x0 >= _P.xn:
    no x-overlap between P and next _P. Then P is packed into its up_connect stacks or initializes a new stack.
    After such test, loaded _P is also tested for x-overlap to the next P.
    If negative, a stack with loaded _P is removed from stack_ (buffer of higher-row stacks) and tested for down_connect_cnt==0.
    If so: no lower-row connections, the stack is packed into connected blobs (referred by its up_connect_),
    else the stack is recycled into next_stack_, for next-row run of scan_P_.
